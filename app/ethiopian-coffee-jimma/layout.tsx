Jimma produces large volumes of earthy, full-bodied coffee that serves as the backbone of many international blends. It accounts for a significant portion of Ethiopia\'s total coffee exports.'

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Jimma coffee has an earthy, full-bodied flavor profile with notes of dark chocolate, tobacco, grain, and mild spice. It has low acidity, a heavy body, and a clean finish. While not as complex as specialty origins like Yirgacheffe or Guji, Jimma\'s consistent, neutral-to-chocolatey character makes it an excellent base for espresso blends and instant coffee production.'
