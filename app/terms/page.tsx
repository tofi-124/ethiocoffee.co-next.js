            <Section title='1) Who We Are'>
              <p>
                The Site is operated by <strong>Ethio Coffee Import and Export PLC</strong> (operating as{' '}
                <strong>Ethio Coffee</strong>) ("Ethio Coffee", "we", "us", or "our"). We are an Ethiopian coffee exporter providing information about
                Ethiopian coffee offerings and facilitating business-to-business inquiries for coffee export supply to importers worldwide.
              </p>

            <Section title='2) Acceptance of These Terms'>
              <p>
                By accessing or using the Site, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Site.
                If you are using the Site on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent that you have
                authority to bind that entity and that entity agrees to these Terms.

            </Section>

            <Section title='3) Business-to-Business Use'>
              <p>
                The Site is intended primarily for <strong>business customers</strong> (e.g., importers, trading companies, roasters with import capability,
                distributors, café chains) seeking Ethiopian green coffee export supply information and quotes. The Site is
                not intended for consumer retail purchases.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title='4) Information Only; No Online Checkout'>
              <p>
                Product descriptions, profiles, origin notes, specifications, and availability shown on the Site are
                for informational purposes. They may change and may vary by lot, season, and shipment. The Site does
                not provide a checkout feature. Purchases (if any) are completed through an off-site, written
                commercial process (e.g., via email, invoice, purchase order, and/or contract).
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title='5) Inquiries, Quote Requests, and Samples'>
              <p>
                You may submit inquiries or quote requests via the Site. Any response, quotation, or indication of
                availability we provide is <strong>non-binding</strong> unless and until confirmed by written acceptance,
                invoice, or contract signed/issued by us.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sample requests are subject to availability and may require additional information. Shipping costs,
                handling fees, and/or sample charges may apply, as communicated to you.

            </Section>

            <Section title='6) Orders, Contracts, and Priority of Terms'>
              <p>
                If you place an order with us, the governing terms for that transaction will be set out in the written
                documents applicable to that order (e.g., quotation, pro forma invoice, commercial invoice, purchase
                order acceptance, and/or a separate supply agreement) ("Order Terms").
              </p>
              <p>
                If there is any conflict between these Terms and the Order Terms, the Order Terms control for that
                transaction.

            </Section>

            <Section title='7) Pricing, Payment, and Taxes'>
              <p>
                Prices and payment terms are determined on a case-by-case basis and will be stated in the applicable
                Order Terms. Standard payment terms for new customers are 50% deposit with 50% due against shipping
                documents. Established customers may qualify for Net 30/60 terms. Letters of Credit are accepted
                from recognized banks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our standard invoicing currency is <strong>USD</strong>. We may also invoice in{' '}
                <strong>EUR</strong> or <strong>GBP</strong> for European buyers upon request.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unless stated otherwise, prices may exclude shipping, insurance, banking fees, customs
                duties, taxes, tariffs, and other charges. You are responsible for any taxes, duties, or government
                charges associated with importation or receipt of goods in your jurisdiction, unless the applicable
                Order Terms expressly provide otherwise.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title='8) Shipping, Delivery, and Risk of Loss'>
              <p>
                Shipping terms (including Incoterms®, freight arrangements, insurance, delivery timelines, and
                transfer of risk) will be set out in the applicable Order Terms. Delivery dates and lead times are
                estimates unless expressly agreed in writing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Export and international logistics may be affected by events outside our control (including port
                delays, customs holds, carrier disruptions, or force majeure events). We are not responsible for
                delays caused by third parties or governmental actions.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title='9) Quality, Lot Variation, and Claims'>
              <p>
                Coffee is an agricultural product; characteristics can vary by harvest, lot, processing, storage, and
                transport conditions. Except as expressly stated in the applicable Order Terms, we do not guarantee
                that every shipment will match a particular flavor note description.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you believe goods are non-conforming or damaged, you must notify us within{' '}
                <strong>seven (7) days</strong> of receipt with photos, cupping notes, and supporting documentation.
                We retain samples from every lot for comparison. Resolution options may include price adjustments,
                replacement coffee, or third-party arbitration.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title='10) Returns, Cancellations, and Refunds'>
              <p>
                Because coffee and related goods are commonly handled and stored under variable conditions, returns
                are generally not accepted unless expressly agreed in writing or required by applicable law. Any
                approved returns, credits, cancellations, or refunds will be handled according to the Order Terms.
