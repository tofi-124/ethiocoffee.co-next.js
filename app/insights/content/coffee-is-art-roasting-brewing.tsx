      <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4'>Why Roasting and Brewing Are Where Origin Quality Lives or Dies</h2>
      <p className='my-4'>
        A perfectly sourced Ethiopian lot can fall flat after a careless roast. A flawless green coffee can taste hollow when brewed with the wrong parameters. The gap between potential and result is where the craft of coffee roasting and brewing operates. This sixth installment of the &quot;Coffee Is&quot; series covers the principles that connect green bean quality to cup quality, written for roasters, importers, and green coffee buyers who need both the framework and the practical detail.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Every roast curve reflects choices about heat application, airflow, and timing. Every brew recipe balances dose, grind, temperature, and contact time. When these choices align with what the green coffee offers, origin character comes through clearly. When they do not, even specialty-grade lots taste generic.

      <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4'>The Science of Coffee Roasting: Heat Transfer and Chemical Change</h2>

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>How Heat Reaches the Bean</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Coffee roasting applies heat through three mechanisms, each contributing differently to flavor development:
      </p>
      <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
        <li><strong>Conduction:</strong> Direct contact between the bean and the hot drum surface. Responsible for initial charge energy and early moisture removal. Excessive conduction causes scorching (dark marks on the flat side of the bean).</li>
        <li><strong>Convection:</strong> Hot air flowing through the bean mass. The primary driver of even roasting in most drum machines. Adjusting fan speed shifts the balance between conductive and convective heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Radiation:</strong> Infrared energy from the drum walls. A smaller factor in commercial roasting but significant in sample roasters with thin drums and high surface temperatures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Understanding which mechanism dominates at each stage of the roast helps explain why the same profile produces different results on different machines. Ethiopian coffees, with their high density and small screen sizes, respond especially well to convection-dominant roasting that builds heat gradually.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>The Four Phases of a Roast</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Every roast moves through four distinct phases. Recognizing them in real time is what allows a roaster to make adjustments rather than follow a curve blindly.
      </p>
      <ol className='list-decimal ml-5 my-4'>
        <li className='my-2'><strong>Drying phase (0:00 to ~4:00):</strong> Moisture drops from 10-12% to under 5%. Beans change from green to pale yellow. Grassy aromas dominate. Rushing this phase produces uneven roasts because the interior stays wet while the surface browns.</li>
        <li className='my-2'><strong>Maillard reaction phase (~4:00 to ~7:30):</strong> Sugars and amino acids react to create browning compounds. Bread, caramel, and nut aromas emerge. The rate of rise (RoR) should decelerate steadily through this phase. A stalling RoR produces baked, flat flavors.</li>
        <li className='my-2'><strong>First crack (~7:30 to ~9:30):</strong> Internal pressure causes the bean to crack audibly, releasing steam and CO₂. This is the transition point where coffee becomes drinkable. Most specialty roasts finish within 60 to 120 seconds after crack onset.</li>
        <li className='my-2'><strong>Development phase (post first crack):</strong> The window between first crack and the end of the roast determines the balance between origin character and roast character. Short development (under 60 seconds) preserves acidity and floral aromatics. Longer development (90 to 120 seconds) builds body and sweetness at the expense of brightness.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Reading and Controlling the Roast Curve</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        A roast curve plots bean temperature against time. Two metrics matter most for roast profile development:
      </p>
      <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
        <li><strong>Bean temperature (BT):</strong> The measured internal temperature of the bean mass. Tracked via a thermocouple probe inserted into the drum. Key milestones include turning point (~150°C), color change (~160°C), first crack (~195-205°C), and drop temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate of rise (RoR):</strong> How fast the bean temperature increases, typically measured in °C per 30 seconds. A healthy RoR declines gradually throughout the roast. A flattening RoR signals potential baking. A rising RoR late in the roast signals potential scorching or crash development.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Profiling software (Cropster, Artisan, Ikawa) records these curves and enables side-by-side comparison across batches. For production consistency, the goal is to replicate the same curve shape within tight tolerances, batch after batch.
      </p>

      <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4'>Roast Levels and What They Mean for Origin Character</h2>

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Light, Medium, and Dark: What Each Preserves and Sacrifices</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Roast level determines how much of the green coffee&apos;s inherent character survives into the cup. This matters directly to importers and buyers who evaluate lots by cupping roasted samples.

        Specialty Ethiopian coffees perform best at light to medium levels where their genetic diversity and terroir express most fully. Pushing a washed Yirgacheffe to second crack destroys the jasmine and bergamot aromatics that justify its premium. A natural Guji at medium roast, however, develops caramelized fruit sweetness that many roasters find ideal for espresso applications.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Development Time Ratio and Its Effect on Flavor Clarity</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Development time ratio (DTR) measures development time as a percentage of total roast time. A DTR of 20-25% is common for specialty light-medium roasts. Below 15%, coffees often taste grassy or underdeveloped. Above 30%, roast character begins to overwhelm origin character.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        For Ethiopian washed lots, targeting 18-22% DTR preserves the floral and citrus notes buyers expect. For natural processed lots, 22-27% DTR allows the fruit sugars to caramelize fully without tipping into carbon bitterness.
      </p>

      <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4'>Sample Roasting vs. Production Roasting</h2>

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Why Sample Roasting Matters for Green Coffee Evaluation</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Before committing to volume, importers and roasters evaluate green coffee through standardized sample roasts. The SCA sample roast protocol targets a light roast (Agtron 58-63 for ground, 63-68 for whole bean) completed in 8 to 12 minutes. The goal is to reveal defects and origin character without imposing roast flavor, ensuring fair comparison across lots.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Sample roasters (Ikawa, Probat BRZ, Phocus) use batch sizes of 50g to 300g with tight temperature control. Consistency matters more than creativity at this stage. A sample roast should represent the green coffee honestly so that cupping evaluations reflect bean quality, not roast decisions.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Scaling a Profile from Sample to Production</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Translating a successful 100g sample profile to a 25kg or 50kg production batch is not linear. Larger batch sizes have higher thermal mass, slower heat transfer, and different airflow dynamics. Key adjustments when scaling:
      </p>
      <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
        <li><strong>Charge temperature:</strong> Typically 10-20°C higher for production batches to compensate for the thermal mass of a larger load.</li>
        <li><strong>Total roast time:</strong> Production roasts often run 1 to 3 minutes longer than sample roasts at equivalent roast levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Airflow management:</strong> Production drums require more aggressive fan settings to achieve even convective heating across the larger bean mass.</li>
        <li><strong>First crack timing:</strong> Expect first crack 30 to 90 seconds later in production than in sample roasts. Adjust development time relative to crack onset, not absolute time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className='my-4'>
        The bridge between sample and production is cupping. Roast a production batch, cup it alongside the approved sample roast, and adjust until the flavor profile matches.

      </p>

      <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4'>Roasting Ethiopian Coffees: Origin-Specific Principles</h2>

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Bean Density, Genetic Diversity, and Why Ethiopian Lots Behave Differently</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Ethiopia is the genetic birthplace of Arabica coffee, with thousands of heirloom varieties growing across diverse microclimates. This diversity means Ethiopian lots vary more in density, screen size, and moisture content than coffees from most other origins. High-altitude lots from Yirgacheffe (1,800-2,200 masl) are denser than lowland coffees from Jimma (1,400-1,600 masl), requiring different charge temperatures and heat application rates.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Sorting by screen size and density before roasting improves consistency. Mixed sizes roast unevenly because smaller beans absorb heat faster. Our lots arrive with detailed physical analysis so your roast planning starts with accurate data.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Washed vs. Natural: How Processing Shapes Roast Approach</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Processing method is the single biggest factor after roast level in determining how Ethiopian coffee tastes. Washed and natural lots from the same region require fundamentally different roast strategies:
      </p>
      <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
        <li><strong>Washed coffees</strong> (Yirgacheffe, Limu, parts of Sidamo): Higher density, lower sugar content at the surface, and more uniform moisture. Roast with a gentle, extended drying phase and short development (60-90 seconds post first crack). Preserve floral aromatics by avoiding aggressive late-stage heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural coffees</strong> (Guji, Harar, Sidamo): More surface sugar from fruit fermentation, slightly lower density, and less uniform moisture. Tolerate longer development (90-120 seconds). The additional sugars caramelize well, creating fruit-forward sweetness. Watch for scorching since the surface sugars burn easily at high charge temperatures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className='my-4'>

      <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4'>The Fundamentals of Coffee Extraction</h2>

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>What Extraction Means and Why 18-22% Is the Target</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Coffee extraction is the process of dissolving soluble compounds from ground coffee into water. Roasted coffee is roughly 30% soluble, but extracting all of it produces an undrinkable cup. The Specialty Coffee Association defines the optimal range as 18-22% extraction yield, where acids, sugars, and bitter compounds balance for a clean, sweet, and complex cup.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Below 18%, cups taste sour, thin, and lack sweetness because acids dissolve first and sugars have not fully extracted. Above 22%, bitter and astringent compounds dominate because they dissolve last and overpower the balance. A refractometer and brewing chart allow precise measurement, but trained tasters can identify extraction problems by flavor alone.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>The Variables That Control Extraction</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Five variables determine extraction rate and evenness. Adjusting any one of them shifts the balance:
      </p>
      <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
        <li><strong>Dose (coffee amount):</strong> More coffee relative to water reduces extraction percentage. Standard ratios range from 1:15 to 1:17 for filter and 1:2 for espresso. A reliable <a href='https://bestcoffeeguide.com/best-coffee-scales/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' className='text-amber-700 hover:underline'>coffee scale</a> is essential for repeatable dosing.</li>
        <li><strong>Grind size:</strong> Finer grinds increase surface area and speed extraction. Espresso requires fine grinds (200-400 microns); pour-over uses medium (400-800 microns); French press uses coarse (800-1,200 microns).</li>
        <li><strong>Water temperature:</strong> Higher temperatures extract faster. The SCA recommends 92-96°C for most methods. Light roasts often benefit from higher temperatures (95-96°C) because their denser cell structure resists extraction.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact time:</strong> Longer contact time increases extraction. Espresso extracts in 25-30 seconds under pressure; pour-over in 2:30-3:30; French press in 4:00-5:00.</li>
        <li><strong>Agitation:</strong> Stirring, pouring technique, and turbulence affect how evenly water contacts the coffee bed. Consistent pour patterns in pour-over produce more even extraction than erratic pouring.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className='my-4'>
        For hands-on recipes that apply these variables to specific Ethiopian regions and processing methods, including pour-over, espresso, and batch brew parameters, see our <Link href='/insights/best-coffee-guide-french-press-pour-over-scales' className='text-amber-700 hover:underline'>Ethiopian coffee brew profiles for roasters</Link>.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Water Chemistry: Mineral Content and Flavor Impact</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Water makes up over 98% of brewed coffee. Its mineral composition directly affects extraction efficiency and cup flavor. The SCA Water Quality Standard recommends 75-250 mg/L total dissolved solids, with an ideal target near 150 mg/L. Calcium and magnesium ions bond to flavor compounds during extraction; too few minerals produce flat, under-extracted cups while too many create harsh, chalky flavors.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        For buyers evaluating green coffee quality, consistent water chemistry during sample preparation removes a variable that can mask or exaggerate defects. Many quality labs use Third Wave Water or BWT-filtered water to standardize evaluation conditions.

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Pour-Over (V60): Clarity and Origin Expression</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Pour-over brewing excels at showcasing origin character, making it the preferred method for evaluating single-origin Ethiopian coffees beyond formal cupping. The thin paper filter removes oils and fines, producing a clean cup where floral, citrus, and fruit notes present with high clarity.

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Espresso: Concentration and Intensity</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Espresso brewing concentrates flavors through high pressure (9 bars) and fine grind, producing a dense shot where sweetness, acidity, and body are amplified. Ethiopian single-origin espressos are increasingly popular, with natural Guji and Sidamo lots performing well as both straight shots and milk-based drinks.

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Immersion Methods: Body and Sweetness</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        French press and cold brew use extended contact time with coarse grinds to produce full-bodied, rounded cups. These methods work well for Ethiopian naturals where the fruit-forward sweetness benefits from longer extraction. For help choosing the right brewer, see this <a href='https://bestcoffeeguide.com/best-french-press-coffee-makers/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' className='text-amber-700 hover:underline'>French press buying guide</a>.
      </p>
      <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
        <li><strong>French press:</strong> 30g coffee, 500g water at 94°C, coarse grind, steep 4:00, plunge slowly. Produces a heavy, oily cup that amplifies body and sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold brew:</strong> 100g coffee, 800g cold water (1:8 ratio), coarse grind, steep 16-18 hours at room temperature, filter and dilute 1:1 to taste. Produces a smooth, low-acid concentrate that highlights chocolate and fruit notes.</li>
        <li><strong>AeroPress:</strong> 18g coffee, 220g water at 92°C, medium-fine grind, 1:30-1:45 total time. Inverted method for fuller body. A versatile, portable option for quick evaluation outside the lab.</li>

      <p className='my-4'>
        When a cup does not taste right, the cause is either a roast defect, a brew defect, or a green coffee defect. Being able to identify which one saves time and prevents misattributing the problem.

      <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4'>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h4 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>What temperature should I roast Ethiopian coffee at?</h4>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Charge between 170°C and 190°C for most Ethiopian lots. Target first crack around 8:30 to 9:30 minutes. For washed coffees, keep development short (60 to 90 seconds) to preserve floral acidity. Natural lots tolerate longer development for fruit caramelization.
      </p>
      <h4 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>How does grind size affect coffee extraction?</h4>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Finer grinds increase surface area and accelerate extraction, producing stronger cups. Coarser grinds slow extraction, yielding lighter and cleaner flavors. Match grind to method: fine for espresso (200-400 microns), medium for pour-over (400-800 microns), coarse for French press (800-1,200 microns).
      </p>
      <h4 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>What is the ideal water temperature for brewing coffee?</h4>
      <p className='my-4'>
        The SCA recommends 92°C to 96°C for most methods. Temperatures below this range under-extract, producing sour and thin cups. Temperatures above it over-extract, pulling harsh and bitter compounds. Light roasts often perform better at the higher end of this range.
      </p>
      <h4 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>What is development time in coffee roasting?</h4>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Development time is the interval between first crack and the end of the roast. It typically ranges from 60 to 120 seconds for light to medium roasts. Shorter development preserves acidity and floral aromatics. Longer development builds body and sweetness but can mute delicate origin character.
      </p>
      <h4 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>How do I know if my coffee is over-extracted or under-extracted?</h4>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Under-extracted coffee tastes sour, thin, and lacks sweetness. Over-extracted coffee tastes bitter, astringent, and dry. A balanced cup has clear acidity, pleasant sweetness, and smooth body. Use a refractometer to target 18-22% extraction, or adjust by taste using grind size and brew time.
