            A cupping score tells you a lot, but not everything. Two Ethiopian lots can both score 86 yet taste nothing alike: one bright with citric acidity, the other rich with stone-fruit sweetness. The difference sits in their chemical compound profiles, physical characteristics, and the sensory science used to evaluate them. Green coffee analysis gives buyers the objective data to understand why.

            Green Coffee Physical Analysis
          </h2>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Physical evaluation is the first checkpoint in green coffee analysis. Three measurements form the baseline: moisture content, density, and screen size. Each one tells you something about what is happening chemically inside the bean and how it will behave during roasting.
          </p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Moisture Content</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Specialty green coffee should hold between 9% and 12% moisture by weight. This range preserves volatile aroma precursors, prevents mold and microbial growth, and keeps the bean structurally sound. Below 9%, cellular walls become brittle; sugars and acids degrade faster, and the bean loses flavor complexity during storage. Above 12%, free water activity accelerates oxidation and creates conditions for ochratoxin A contamination.
          </p>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Moisture meters (capacitance or near-infrared types) provide readings in seconds. Take at least three readings per bag and average them. Consistent moisture across a lot signals uniform drying at origin, a strong quality indicator.
          </p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Density</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Bean density reflects cellular structure, altitude of cultivation, and compound concentration. High-altitude Ethiopian coffees (1,800-2,200m) grow slowly in cooler temperatures, producing denser beans with more tightly packed sugars, acids, and aroma precursors. Denser beans absorb heat more gradually during roasting, allowing more complex flavor development.
          </p>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Measure bulk density by weighing a fixed volume of green beans in a standardized cylinder. Higher bulk density (above ~680 g/L for washed Arabica) generally correlates with higher cup quality, though the relationship is not absolute.
          </p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Screen Size</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Screen size measures bean dimensions through mesh sieves graded in 64ths of an inch. Ethiopian specialty lots typically grade between Screen 14 and Screen 18. Uniform screen size within a lot matters more than absolute size: it ensures even heat transfer during roasting, which produces consistent extraction and flavor clarity in the cup.
          </p>

          <div className='bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6 border border-blue-200'>

                <strong>Tip for buyers:</strong> Physical analysis tells you how a lot was handled before it reached you.

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Organic Acids: The Foundation of Acidity</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Organic acids compose roughly 5% of green coffee by weight and establish the brightness that separates specialty from commodity grades. The most important are citric acid (the same compound that gives lemons their bite), malic acid (green apple tartness), acetic acid (vinegar-like when excessive), and quinic acid (astringent bitterness that increases in stale coffee).
          </p>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Citric and malic acids are the primary drivers of positive acidity in the cup. High-altitude Ethiopian lots, particularly from{' '}
            <Link href='/ethiopian-coffee-yirgacheffe' className='underline font-bold'>Yirgacheffe</Link>{' '}
            and{' '}
            <Link href='/ethiopian-coffee-guji' className='underline font-bold'>Guji</Link>,{' '}
            accumulate higher concentrations of these acids during slow cherry maturation. Roasters working with these lots will notice the acids survive light to medium roast profiles, producing the bright, clean acidity prized in specialty markets.
          </p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Chlorogenic Acids: The Complexity Engine</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Chlorogenic acids (CGAs) are the most abundant phenolic compounds in green coffee, comprising 6-10% by weight. They are not a single molecule but a family of ester compounds formed between hydroxycinnamic acids and quinic acid. The three main subgroups are caffeoylquinic acids (CQA), dicaffeoylquinic acids (diCQA), and feruloylquinic acids (FQA).
          </p>
          <p className='my-4'>
            During roasting, CGAs break down progressively. Light roasts retain more CGAs, contributing perceived acidity and some bitterness. As roast level increases, CGA degradation produces quinic acid and caffeic acid, which add body and a sharper bitterness. This is why dark roasts taste more bitter and less acidic: the CGA profile has been fundamentally altered.
          </p>
          <p className='my-4'>
            For buyers, CGA content correlates with altitude. Arabica grown above 1,600 meters typically contains more CGAs than lower-grown coffees, contributing to the complexity that commands higher prices in specialty markets.
          </p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Sugars and Maillard Precursors</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Sucrose is the dominant sugar in green Arabica (6-9% by weight) and the primary fuel for caramelization and Maillard reactions during roasting. Reducing sugars (glucose and fructose) are present in smaller amounts but are more reactive: they combine with free amino acids in the Maillard reaction to produce hundreds of volatile compounds responsible for roasted, nutty, caramel, and chocolate notes.
          </p>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Higher sucrose content in green coffee predicts greater sweetness potential after roasting. Natural-processed Ethiopian coffees often show elevated sugar levels because the mucilage remains on the bean during drying, allowing sugar migration into the seed. This is one chemical reason why{' '}
            <Link href='/insights/washed-vs-natural-ethiopian-coffee-processing' className='underline font-bold'>natural Ethiopians</Link>{' '}
            tend toward fruit-forward, sweet profiles.
          </p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Caffeine and Alkaloids</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Caffeine accounts for 1.0-1.5% of green Arabica by weight and contributes 10-30% of perceived bitterness in brewed coffee. Unlike most other compounds, caffeine is thermally stable: it survives roasting nearly intact. Its bitterness is modulated by interactions with chlorogenic acids and other compounds, which is why caffeine content alone does not predict bitterness intensity.
          </p>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Trigonelline (0.6-1.2% by weight) is the second major alkaloid. During roasting, it degrades into pyridines and N-methylpyridinium, which contribute roasted aroma and may have antioxidant properties. Trigonelline content correlates with perceived sweetness in some studies, making it a compound of interest for quality prediction.
          </p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Lipids: Body and Aroma Preservation</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Green coffee lipids (10-16% by weight) are predominantly triglycerides and free fatty acids concentrated in the bean&apos;s endosperm oil. They largely survive roasting and serve two critical functions in the cup: providing body and mouthfeel, and acting as carriers that trap and slowly release volatile aroma compounds during brewing.
          </p>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Lipid oxidation is a primary mechanism of staling in both green and roasted coffee. In green beans, exposure to heat, light, and oxygen accelerates fat oxidation, producing rancid off-flavors. This is why proper{' '}
            <Link href='/insights/green-coffee-shelf-life-storage-guide' className='underline font-bold'>storage conditions</Link>{' '}
            (cool, dark, low humidity) are essential for preserving lot quality during transit and warehousing.
          </p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Volatile Aroma Precursors</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Green coffee has minimal aroma on its own. Instead, it contains precursor molecules (aldehydes, amino acids, organic acids, sugars) that roasting converts into 800+ volatile compounds. Key volatile groups include:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
            <li><strong>Furanones:</strong> Caramel and sweet notes (e.g., furaneol)</li>
            <li><strong>Pyrazines:</strong> Roasted, nutty, earthy character</li>
            <li><strong>Esters:</strong> Fruity aromatics (prominent in high-quality naturals)</li>
            <li><strong>Aldehydes:</strong> Floral and herbal notes (e.g., linalool precursors in Yirgacheffe lots)</li>
            <li><strong>Sulfur compounds:</strong> Roasted, savory complexity at low thresholds</li>
          </ul>
          <p className='my-4'>
            The precursor profile is largely set by genetics and growing conditions. Ethiopian heirloom varieties grown at high altitude in regions like{' '}
            <Link href='/ethiopian-coffee-yirgacheffe' className='underline font-bold'>Yirgacheffe</Link> and{' '}
            <Link href='/ethiopian-coffee-guji' className='underline font-bold'>Guji</Link>{' '}
            carry higher concentrations of ester and aldehyde precursors, which is why these origins consistently produce the floral and citrus aromatics that define Ethiopian specialty coffee.

            Sensory Science and Flavor Perception
          </h2>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Coffee flavor is not a property of the liquid alone. It is constructed by the human brain from three sensory channels: taste, aroma, and tactile perception. Understanding how each channel works improves cupping accuracy and helps buyers communicate quality attributes more precisely.
          </p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>The Five Tastes and Their Chemical Triggers</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Taste receptors on the tongue detect five basic modalities. In coffee, four are directly relevant:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
            <li><strong>Sweet:</strong> Triggered by sucrose breakdown products, certain amino acids, and some sugar alcohols. Perceived sweetness in coffee is often subtle and emerges most clearly in high-quality, well-roasted lots.</li>
            <li><strong>Sour/Acidic:</strong> Driven by organic acids (citric, malic, phosphoric). Positive acidity is the single most valued attribute in specialty coffee judging. It provides structure and brightness.</li>
            <li><strong>Bitter:</strong> Caffeine contributes 10-30%; the remainder comes from CGA degradation products, quinic acid, and Maillard reaction byproducts. Bitterness is expected in coffee; excessive or harsh bitterness signals defects or over-extraction.</li>
            <li><strong>Salty:</strong> Mineral content (potassium, magnesium) provides a faint saltiness that balances acidity. Rarely dominant, but its absence can make coffee taste flat.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Umami appears in coffee primarily through certain amino acid derivatives, though its role is less prominent than in food. Research from the Specialty Coffee Association suggests umami-like characteristics may contribute to perceived &quot;depth&quot; in some coffees.
          </p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Aroma Perception: The Dominant Channel</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Aroma accounts for roughly 80% of perceived flavor complexity. It reaches the olfactory epithelium through two pathways:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
            <li><strong>Orthonasal:</strong> Sniffing volatiles directly from the cup before sipping. During cupping, this is the &quot;fragrance&quot; (dry grounds) and &quot;aroma&quot; (wet crust) evaluation phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Retronasal:</strong> Volatiles released in the mouth travel up through the nasopharynx to the olfactory receptors. This is where most flavor complexity is perceived during sipping and slurping.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className='my-4'>
            The olfactory system can distinguish thousands of volatile compounds, but it interprets them contextually. A cupper detects &quot;blueberry&quot; not because the coffee contains blueberry molecules but because a specific combination of esters, aldehydes, and acids triggers the same neural pattern as blueberry aroma. This is why calibration against reference standards (such as the{' '}
            <a href='https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/resources/sensory-lexicon' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' className='underline font-bold'>World Coffee Research Sensory Lexicon</a>) matters for consistent evaluation.
          </p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Body and Mouthfeel</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Body is a tactile sensation, not a taste. It describes the weight, viscosity, and texture of coffee in the mouth. Three compound groups drive it:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
            <li><strong>Lipids:</strong> Coffee oils create a coating sensation. Higher lipid content (typical in{' '}
              <Link href='/ethiopian-coffee-harar' className='underline font-bold'>Harar</Link> and some natural-processed lots) increases perceived body.</li>
            <li><strong>Polysaccharides:</strong> Galactomannans and arabinogalactans extracted during brewing add viscosity. Espresso extracts more polysaccharides than filter methods, explaining the difference in body.</li>
            <li><strong>Extraction level:</strong> Under-extracted coffee feels thin and watery. Over-extracted coffee feels astringent and drying. The optimal range produces a smooth, clean mouthfeel.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mt-6 mb-3'>Sensory Bias and Calibration</h3>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Human perception is powerful but unreliable without controls. Four biases consistently appear in cupping sessions:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
            <li><strong>Adaptation:</strong> Sensitivity drops after repeated exposure. If you cup the same origin repeatedly in a session, your palate becomes less discriminating. Solution: vary sample order and insert palate cleansers.</li>
            <li><strong>Contrast effects:</strong> A mediocre coffee tastes better after a poor one and worse after an excellent one. Solution: blind cupping with randomized presentation.</li>
            <li><strong>Expectation bias:</strong> Knowing the origin, price, or grade before tasting unconsciously shifts your scoring. Solution: mask all lot information during evaluation.</li>
            <li><strong>Halo effect:</strong> A strong positive attribute (e.g., exceptional aroma) inflates scores for unrelated attributes (e.g., body). Solution: score each attribute independently, and calibrate regularly with reference samples.</li>
          </ul>

            Lab and Green Coffee Analysis Methodology
          </h2>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Effective green coffee analysis does not require a full chemistry lab. Most quality decisions can be made with a moisture meter, a density kit, sieves, and a disciplined cupping protocol. Advanced tools add precision but are optional for most buyers.
          </p>

              <p className='text-sm mt-1'>A standardized 1-liter cylinder and a precision scale. Fill the cylinder, level the top, and weigh. Compare against baseline values for the origin and process type. Washed Ethiopian Arabica typically falls between 650-720 g/L.</p>
            </div>
            <div className='border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-5'>
              <p className='font-bold'>Screen Sieves</p>
              <p className='text-sm mt-1'>A stack of graduated mesh screens (14-19) separates beans by size. Record the percentage retained on each screen. Uniformity across 1-2 adjacent screens signals consistent sorting at origin.</p>
            </div>
            <div className='border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-5'>
              <p className='font-bold'>Sample Roaster</p>
              <p className='text-sm mt-1'>A small-batch roaster (50-150g capacity) for producing cupping samples. Consistent light roast profiles (Agtron 55-65 for ground) are essential for comparable evaluations across lots.</p>

          <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
            <li><strong>NIR Spectroscopy:</strong> Non-destructive rapid analysis of moisture, density, and some chemical parameters. Increasingly used at origin for fast lot screening.</li>
            <li><strong>HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography):</strong> Precise quantification of chlorogenic acids, caffeine, trigonelline, and organic acids. Primarily a research and certification tool.</li>
            <li><strong>Refractometry:</strong> Measures total dissolved solids (TDS) in brewed coffee to verify extraction levels during cupping. A refractometer paired with a cupping protocol gives both sensory and extraction data.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Activity Meters:</strong> Measure free (available) water in green beans rather than total moisture. More predictive of microbial risk during storage than standard moisture meters.</li>

            From Green Coffee Analysis to Buying Decisions
          </h2>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Physical data, compound knowledge, and cupping results are most powerful when combined. A single metric in isolation tells an incomplete story:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-5 my-4'>
            <li>A lot with 11.8% moisture and low density may have been under-dried then re-moistened. Cup it carefully for ferment or mold taints.</li>
            <li>High density combined with bright cupping acidity confirms slow maturation at altitude. This is the physical signature of high-quality Ethiopian highland coffee.</li>
            <li>A cupping score of 85 with flat acidity and heavy body suggests the lot may be from a lower altitude or over-fermented. Check the origin elevation and processing data.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className='my-4'>
            Build a lot card for every sample you evaluate: moisture, density, screen size, defect count, cupping score, and specific tasting notes. Over time, this database becomes your most valuable sourcing tool. You will start seeing patterns between physical data and cup performance that let you make faster, more confident buying decisions.

          <p className='my-4'>
            Green coffee analysis transforms subjective impressions into objective data. The compounds inside the bean (acids, sugars, lipids, caffeine, volatile precursors) determine what is possible in the cup. Physical measurements (moisture, density, screen size) reveal how well those compounds were preserved from harvest to export. Sensory evaluation, grounded in an understanding of taste, aroma, and perception bias, translates compound data into actionable buying decisions.
          </p>
          <p className='my-4'>
            At Ethio Coffee Import and Export PLC, we apply these quality evaluation methods at every stage of our sourcing process, drawing on three decades of heritage sourcing relationships across Ethiopia&apos;s coffee regions. Every lot we ship includes pre-shipment samples, moisture data, and cupping reports so our partners can verify quality before committing.

            <div>
              <h4 className='text-lg font-bold text-dark mb-2'>What moisture content should green coffee have?</h4>
              <p className='text-gray-700'>
                Specialty green coffee should maintain 9-12% moisture by weight. Below 9%, beans become brittle and lose flavor compound integrity. Above 12%, free water activity promotes mold growth and accelerates oxidation. For export-quality Ethiopian lots, the target range is typically 10-11.5%.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h4 className='text-lg font-bold text-dark mb-2'>How do chlorogenic acids affect coffee flavor?</h4>
              <p className='text-gray-700'>
                Chlorogenic acids (6-10% of green coffee) break down during roasting into quinic acid and caffeic acid. At light roast levels, they contribute perceived acidity and complexity. At darker levels, their degradation products increase bitterness and body. Higher-altitude Arabica typically contains more CGAs, correlating with brighter acidity.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className='text-lg font-bold text-dark mb-2'>Why does altitude affect green coffee chemistry?</h4>
              <p className='text-gray-700'>
                Cooler temperatures at higher altitudes slow cherry maturation by weeks or months. This extended development period allows more complex sugars, organic acids, and volatile aroma precursors to accumulate. Ethiopian coffees grown above 1,800m consistently show higher density, brighter acidity, and greater aromatic complexity.

                A calibrated moisture meter, a bulk density cylinder with precision scale, screen sieves, and a sample roaster cover the essentials. Pair these with a structured cupping protocol and you can make well-informed buying decisions without expensive laboratory equipment.

              <p className='text-gray-700'>
                Natural processing retains mucilage sugars around the bean during drying, increasing perceived sweetness and fruit character. Washed processing removes mucilage early, producing cleaner acid profiles. The same variety from the same farm can taste markedly different depending on process. See our{' '}
