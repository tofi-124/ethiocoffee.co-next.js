        </h3>
        <p className='text-sm leading-relaxed'>
          Nekemte coffee, traded internationally under the name &quot;Lekempti,&quot; is one of western Ethiopia&apos;s most distinctive origin categories. Grown across four Wollega administrative zones at altitudes of 1,500 to 2,400 meters, Nekemte lots deliver chocolate, citrus, and honey notes with medium body and balanced acidity. Natural processing dominates, producing tropical fruit and jasmine characteristics with a long sweet aftertaste, while washed lots offer cleaner floral and black tea profiles. Available in Grades 3 through 5 for both washed and natural processing, Nekemte represents one of the strongest value propositions in Ethiopian specialty coffee for importers seeking differentiated western Ethiopian origins.

      {/* INTRODUCTION */}
      <p className='text-lg leading-relaxed my-4'>
        While Yirgacheffe and Guji dominate specialty coffee conversations about Ethiopia, the country&apos;s western highlands produce some of its most underrated and commercially compelling coffees. Nekemte, the capital city of Oromia&apos;s East Wollega Zone, has served as the primary trade hub for western Ethiopian coffee for over a century. Coffees channeled through this city earned the trade name &quot;Lekempti&quot; on international markets, a designation that persists on the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX) and on green coffee contracts worldwide.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        For importers and roasters building diversified Ethiopian sourcing programs, Nekemte/Lekempti coffee offers a distinct alternative to the citrus-and-floral profiles of eastern and southern Ethiopian origins. The region&apos;s chocolate-forward, nutty character with honey sweetness and balanced acidity makes it particularly well-suited for espresso blends, single-origin drip programs, and cold brew applications. This guide maps the four Wollega sub-zones, explains how production systems shape cup quality, benchmarks FOB pricing, and outlines a practical sourcing path for wholesale buyers.

        1. What Is Nekemte Coffee? The Lekempti Trade Name Explained
      </h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        The distinction between &quot;Nekemte&quot; and &quot;Lekempti&quot; confuses many first-time buyers. Nekemte (also spelled Nekempte or Nekempt) is the city in western Ethiopia through which all Wollega-region coffees are aggregated, graded, and channeled for export. &quot;Lekempti&quot; is the trade name assigned to these coffees on the ECX and in international commerce, much as &quot;Harar&quot; designates eastern Ethiopian coffees traded through the city of Harar regardless of the specific woreda of cultivation.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        In practical terms, a &quot;Lekempti Grade 4 Natural&quot; on an export contract could originate from any of the four Wollega administrative zones, spanning elevations from 1,500 to 2,400 meters. The trade name tells the buyer the processing method, grade, and broad origin region, but not the specific sub-zone or woreda. Buyers seeking greater traceability should request lot-level documentation specifying the woreda and, where available, the washing station or cooperative name.
      </p>

      <div className='border-l-4 border-amber-500 pl-6 bg-gray-50 p-4 my-6'>
        <p className='italic text-gray-700'>
          &quot;Lekempti is to western Ethiopia what Djimmah is to the southwest: a commercial trade name grouping coffees from a broad growing area under a single market designation. The name originates from the city, not the farm.&quot;
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className='my-4'>
        On the ECX, Lekempti coffees are classified separately from Sidamo, Yirgacheffe, Harar, Jimma (Djimmah), and other named origins. This classification means Lekempti lots are cupped and graded independently, giving buyers a reliable benchmark for cup quality within the western Ethiopian category. The ECX classification also means Nekemte/Lekempti coffee has its own price discovery, which typically runs below Yirgacheffe or Guji but above Djimmah lots of the same grade.

        2. Wollega Sub-Zones: East, West, Kellem, and Horo Guduru
      </h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        The broader Wollega coffee-growing area spans four administrative zones within Oromia. Each zone contributes distinct characteristics based on altitude, microclimate, and dominant production system. Understanding these sub-zones enables importers to target specific cup profiles rather than purchasing undifferentiated commercial Lekempti lots.

          <p className='text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2'>
            The primary aggregation zone centered around Nekemte city. East Wollega produces the largest volume of Lekempti-designated coffee and hosts the majority of the region&apos;s washing stations and dry mills. Coffee from woredas like Guto Gida, Sibu Sire, and Diga offers the classic Nekemte profile: medium body, chocolate and nut base, pleasant acidity, and honey sweetness. Both semi-forest and garden production systems are prevalent here.

          <p className='text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2'>
            Stretching toward the Benishangul-Gumuz border, West Wollega contributes significant commercial volume. Coffees tend toward heavier body and stronger tropical fruit notes in natural-processed lots. The lower altitude range in some woredas produces a slightly earthier cup than East Wollega, though higher-elevation kebeles deliver clean, sweet lots. Semi-forest coffee production dominates, with trees growing under native Cordia Africana and Albizia canopy.

          <p className='text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2'>
            The highest-altitude Wollega sub-zone, Kellem Wollega is gaining attention from specialty buyers for its bright acidity and floral complexity. Woredas like Dale Sadi and Dale Wabera produce lots that rival mid-tier Guji coffees in cupping scores. The extreme altitude slows cherry maturation significantly, resulting in denser beans with higher sugar content. Limited infrastructure means smaller volumes reach export markets, creating both opportunity and supply-chain challenges for buyers.

            Located in the northeastern portion of the Wollega area, Horo Guduru is an emerging coffee zone with increasing research attention from the Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC). The zone&apos;s research stations have evaluated advanced Arabica lines for yield and disease resistance. Commercial coffee from Horo Guduru typically enters the market blended into broader Lekempti lots, but single-zone offerings are beginning to appear from progressive exporters.

        Combined coffee production across West and East Wollega was reported at approximately 40,600 tonnes annually, according to Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency data. When Kellem and Horo Guduru volumes are included, the broader Wollega area represents one of Ethiopia&apos;s largest Arabica production clusters by volume, though a smaller share reaches specialty-grade markets compared to Guji or Yirgacheffe.

      </h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Western Ethiopia&apos;s Wollega region is part of the country&apos;s montane rainforest belt, a zone of high rainfall (1,400 to 1,800 mm annually), deep Nitisol soils, and dense indigenous forest cover. This agro-ecological profile creates conditions fundamentally different from the drier eastern highlands around Harar or the volcanic plateaus of Guji and Sidamo.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Coffee in the Wollega area is produced under three distinct systems, each affecting cup quality and supply reliability in different ways:

      <p className='my-4'>
        The prevalence of semi-forest and garden production in Wollega means that a large share of the region&apos;s output qualifies for <Link href='/insights/ethiopian-coffee-certifications-organic-fairtrade-rainforest' className='text-amber-700 hover:underline font-bold'>organic certification</Link> with minimal transition, since synthetic inputs are rarely used. For buyers targeting certified organic supply chains, Nekemte/Lekempti coffee offers significant volume availability compared to smaller specialty origins that struggle to aggregate certified lots.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Varietal composition across Wollega is dominated by regional heirloom landraces, a genetically diverse population of indigenous Arabica cultivars that have adapted to local conditions over centuries. JARC has also released improved selections in some areas, particularly in Horo Guduru, to address coffee berry disease (CBD) and coffee leaf rust (CLR) pressures. The interplay of wild heirloom genetics and high-altitude semi-forest growing conditions is the primary driver of Nekemte coffee&apos;s distinctive character.

        Natural (dry) processing dominates Nekemte/Lekempti coffee production, reflecting both the region&apos;s traditions and its infrastructure reality. Washed processing capacity has expanded in recent years, particularly in East Wollega and Kellem Wollega, where new washing stations have come online. Understanding the flavor implications of each method helps importers match Nekemte lots to their target market applications.

      <p className='my-4'>
        Natural-processed Nekemte coffees are the region&apos;s signature. The tropical fruit and jasmine notes with a long, sweet aftertaste are characteristics that distinguish Lekempti naturals from the berry-forward naturals of Guji or the wine-like naturals of Harar. The chocolate and nut base notes provide a foundation that makes these coffees particularly versatile in blending applications.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Washed Nekemte lots are less common but increasingly available from stations in East Wollega and Kellem Wollega. These lots present a cleaner, more citrus-forward profile with floral aromatics and a black tea finish. While washed Lekempti is unlikely to compete directly with top-tier Yirgacheffe washed lots on floral complexity, it offers excellent value for buyers seeking clean Ethiopian washed coffees at a more accessible price point.

        <p className='text-sm text-gray-700'>
          Natural-processed Nekemte Grade 3 and Grade 4 coffees are widely used by European roasters as a base component in espresso blends. The chocolate-nut foundation provides body and sweetness, while the tropical fruit undertone adds complexity without the aggressive acidity that some eastern Ethiopian origins introduce. At a lower FOB price point than Guji or Yirgacheffe, Nekemte naturals offer an excellent cost-per-cup ratio for commercial espresso programs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className='my-4'>
        Cupping scores for commercial Nekemte/Lekempti lots typically range from 78 to 84 on the SCA scale, placing them firmly in the high-commercial to low-specialty range. However, single-washing-station lots from Kellem Wollega and select East Wollega woredas have achieved scores in the 85 to 87 range, particularly from washed lots processed at newer, well-managed stations. These micro-lots represent the emerging specialty frontier for western Ethiopian coffee.

        5. Grading and Export Specifications
      </h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Nekemte/Lekempti coffee follows the standard <Link href='/coffee-grading-ethiopia' className='text-amber-700 hover:underline font-bold'>Ethiopian coffee grading system</Link>, which evaluates raw (green) bean physical quality and cup quality on a combined scale. Grades are assigned separately for washed and natural-processed lots, with Grade 1 being the highest and Grade 9/UG (Under Grade) the lowest.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        In practice, the majority of export-grade Nekemte coffee falls within Grades 3 through 5 for both washed and natural processing. Grade 1 and Grade 2 Lekempti lots are rare in the market, though AMG Coffee Export and other specialized exporters report offering Grades 1 through 4 for buyers willing to commit to premium pricing and advance lot reservation.

      </h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Nekemte/Lekempti coffee occupies a mid-tier pricing position in the Ethiopian export market. It commands higher prices than Djimmah (Jimma) commercial lots but trades below the premium levels established by Yirgacheffe, Guji, and Sidamo specialty grades. This positioning makes Nekemte an attractive option for importers who need Ethiopian cup character at accessible price points.

            <h4 className='font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2'>What is the difference between Nekemte and Lekempti coffee?</h4>
            <p className='text-sm text-gray-600'>
              They refer to the same coffee. Nekemte is the city in western Ethiopia that serves as the trade hub, while Lekempti (also Lekempte) is the commercial trade name used on the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange and in international contracts. Any coffee from the four Wollega zones that passes through the Nekemte trade channel is classified as Lekempti on export documentation.

          <div>
            <h4 className='font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2'>How does Nekemte coffee taste compared to Yirgacheffe or Guji?</h4>
            <p className='text-sm text-gray-600'>
              Nekemte coffees are generally less floral and less acidic than Yirgacheffe, and less fruit-forward than Guji. The profile leans toward chocolate, nuts, and honey with a medium body and balanced acidity. Natural-processed lots introduce tropical fruit and jasmine notes. Think of Nekemte as the &quot;smooth, sweet, and balanced&quot; counterpart to the &quot;bright and floral&quot; character of eastern Ethiopian origins. See our <Link href='/insights/guji-coffee-sourcing-guide' className='text-amber-700 hover:underline font-bold'>Guji sourcing guide</Link> and <Link href='/insights/yirgacheffe-coffee-sourcing-guide' className='text-amber-700 hover:underline font-bold'>Yirgacheffe sourcing guide</Link> for detailed comparisons.

            <p className='text-sm text-gray-600'>
              Standard minimum order for export is one full 20-foot container, approximately 250 to 320 bags of 60 kg (15 to 19.2 tonnes). Some exporters offer half-container or LCL (less-than-container-load) shipments at a premium per-kilogram cost. For sample orders, most exporters can ship 1 to 5 bags via air freight for evaluation purposes. <Link href='/contact-us' className='text-amber-700 hover:underline font-bold'>Contact us</Link> for flexible ordering options.

            <p className='text-sm text-gray-600'>
              Yes. A significant portion of Wollega coffee qualifies for organic certification due to the prevalence of semi-forest and garden production systems that use minimal or no synthetic inputs. USDA Organic, EU Organic, and JAS Organic certified lots are available from exporters with <Link href='/insights/ethiopian-coffee-certifications-organic-fairtrade-rainforest' className='text-amber-700 hover:underline font-bold'>active certification programs</Link>.

              The Wollega harvest runs from October through January, with fresh crop available for export from approximately March through August. The best selection and most competitive pricing are available from March to May. By July, remaining stock from the current crop year may be limited. Initiate sample requests by February and confirm contracts by April for optimal lot access.

            <h4 className='font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2'>Can I get single-origin Kellem Wollega or specific sub-zone lots?</h4>
            <p className='text-sm text-gray-600'>
              Increasingly, yes. Progressive exporters are beginning to offer sub-zone-specific and single-washing-station lots from Kellem Wollega and East Wollega. These lots command a premium over standard Lekempti-graded coffee but offer greater traceability and, in many cases, higher cupping scores. Communicate your sub-zone preference clearly when requesting samples.
