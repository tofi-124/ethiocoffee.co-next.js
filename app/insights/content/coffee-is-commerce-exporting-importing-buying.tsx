        <p className='text-sm leading-relaxed'>
          Coffee commerce runs on two parallel systems. The C market (ICE Arabica futures in New York) sets commodity baselines for 90 to 95% of global volume, while specialty coffee adds quality-based differentials on top. In the 2024/25 season, C market prices surged past $4.00/lb for the first time, compressing margins across the chain. Importers and roasters who understand how futures pricing, Incoterms, and the pricing waterfall work can negotiate more effectively, manage risk, and build sourcing relationships that survive volatile markets.

      {/* INTRODUCTION */}
      <p className='my-4'>
        Arabica coffee futures on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) broke above $4.00 per pound in early 2025 for the first time in the contract&apos;s history. That record forced every participant in coffee commerce, from exporters in Addis Ababa to roasters in Berlin, to recalculate margins, renegotiate contracts, and reconsider risk. If you buy, sell, or trade green coffee, the mechanics behind that price movement are not academic. They determine what you pay, when you pay it, and whether your supply chain holds together when conditions shift.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        This fourth installment of the &quot;Coffee Is&quot; series examines coffee commerce: the system that connects a washed Yirgacheffe lot sitting in an Addis Ababa warehouse to a roastery in Toronto, Tokyo, or Dubai. It covers the C market, specialty pricing differentials, export and import logistics, the pricing waterfall from farmgate to roaster, the buying process, risk management tools, and the transparency standards that hold the system together.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Ethiopia exported approximately 469,000 metric tons of coffee in 2024/25 and earned a record $2.65 billion in revenue, according to the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Authority. That volume moved through a defined commercial pipeline. This article maps the commercial logic behind that pipeline, so you can source more effectively within it.
      </p>

      {/* SECTION 1: THE C MARKET */}
      <h2 id='c-market' className='text-3xl font-extrabold mt-10 mb-4'>
        <HiOutlineChartBar className='inline mr-2 text-amber-600' /> 1. The C Market: How Commodity Coffee Is Priced
      </h2>

      <p className='my-4'>
        The C market is the global benchmark for Arabica coffee pricing. It operates on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in New York as the Coffee C Futures contract (ticker: KC). Each contract represents 37,500 pounds (approximately 250 bags of 60 kg) of exchange-grade washed Arabica, deliverable in March, May, July, September, and December.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Prices on the C market are quoted in US cents per pound. When traders refer to &quot;the market&quot; or &quot;the New York price,&quot; they mean the nearby KC futures contract. This price serves as the baseline from which most Arabica coffee worldwide is bought and sold, whether commodity or specialty grade.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>What Drives C Market Volatility</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Four primary forces move C market prices:
      </p>
      <ul className='list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 text-sm my-4'>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Brazil&apos;s crop cycle:</span> Brazil produces roughly 35% of global coffee. A frost warning, drought, or bumper harvest in Minas Gerais can swing prices 20 to 30 cents in a single session.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Supply-demand balance:</span> Global coffee consumption grows approximately 2% per year. When production lags (as it did in 2024/25 due to weather disruptions in Brazil and Vietnam), inventories draw down and prices rise.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Currency movements:</span> The Brazilian real is the most influential currency in coffee. A weaker real makes Brazilian coffee cheaper in dollar terms, pressuring prices; a stronger real does the opposite.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Speculative positioning:</span> Managed money (hedge funds and commodity trading advisors) holds large positions in coffee futures. Their buying or selling amplifies price moves beyond what fundamentals alone would produce.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>How Differentials Work</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Most physical coffee is not traded at the flat C market price. Instead, it trades at &quot;the C plus or minus a differential.&quot; The differential is a premium or discount that adjusts the benchmark price for a specific origin, grade, quality, and delivery terms.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Ethiopian washed coffee typically commands a positive differential. A Yirgacheffe Grade 1 lot might trade at &quot;C + $0.80/lb&quot; or higher depending on cup score and availability. By contrast, lower-grade or commercial coffees from some origins trade at significant discounts. The differential reflects what the market values in that specific coffee relative to the exchange-grade baseline.

      <h2 id='specialty-pricing' className='text-3xl font-extrabold mt-10 mb-4'>
        <HiOutlineCurrencyDollar className='inline mr-2 text-amber-600' /> 2. Specialty Coffee Pricing: Quality-Based Differentials
      </h2>

      <p className='my-4'>
        Specialty coffee is defined commercially by a cupping score of 80 or above on the SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) scale. That score, assigned through systematic sensory evaluation of aroma, flavor, acidity, body, balance, and overall impression, separates specialty from commodity in both quality terms and pricing mechanics.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>How Specialty Premiums Are Calculated</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Specialty coffee can be priced in three ways:
      </p>
      <ul className='list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 text-sm my-4'>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Differential pricing:</span> The coffee is priced at &quot;C market + differential,&quot; where the differential reflects quality, origin, certifications, and relationship terms. This method ties the final price to futures market movements.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Fixed pricing (outright):</span> Buyer and seller agree on a flat FOB price per pound or kilogram, independent of C market movements. This provides price certainty for both parties but exposes whoever took the position to market risk.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Floor-price agreements:</span> A hybrid model where the price is indexed to the C market but cannot fall below a guaranteed minimum. This protects producers from severe downturns while allowing upside when markets are strong.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className='my-4'>
        The 2023 Specialty Coffee Transaction Guide reported that the median price for an 83-point coffee fell from $2.74 to $2.20 per pound when the C market declined, showing that even specialty is not fully insulated from commodity price movements. By contrast, the median price for 87-point coffee rose to $4.91 per green pound, demonstrating that higher cup scores provide better price stability.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>Ethiopian Specialty as a Pricing Example</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Ethiopian specialty coffee commands some of the highest premiums in global coffee commerce. A washed <Link href='/ethiopian-coffee-yirgacheffe' className='underline'>Yirgacheffe</Link> Grade 1 with a cupping score of 86+ typically trades at a significant positive differential above the C market. <Link href='/ethiopian-coffee-guji' className='underline'>Guji</Link> naturals with berry and tropical fruit profiles attract similar premiums, particularly from specialty roasters in Japan, South Korea, and Northern Europe.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        These premiums exist because Ethiopian coffee offers genetic diversity (thousands of <Link href='/insights/ethiopian-heirloom-coffee-varieties-landraces' className='underline'>heirloom varieties</Link>), distinct terroir across regions, and established quality infrastructure including the CLU (Coffee Liquoring Unit) inspection system.

      </h2>

      <p className='my-4'>
        Coffee exporting is the origin-side process that transforms milled green coffee into a documented, inspected, customs-cleared shipment loaded onto a vessel. In Ethiopia, this process runs through a regulated pipeline: sourcing (via ECX auction or Direct Specialty License), dry milling, CLU quality inspection, documentation, customs clearance, inland transport to Djibouti, and port handling.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        The full step-by-step process with day-by-day timelines, documentation checklists, and cost breakdowns is covered in our <Link href='/insights/ethiopian-coffee-export-process-buyers-guide' className='underline font-bold'>Ethiopian coffee export process guide</Link>. For how the ECX and Direct Specialty License channels work, see the <Link href='/insights/ecx-and-ethiopian-coffee-export' className='underline font-bold'>ECX and Ethiopian coffee export guide</Link>.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>Ethiopia&apos;s Two Export Channels</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Ethiopian coffee reaches international markets through two channels. The <span className='font-semibold'>ECX (Ethiopia Commodity Exchange) channel</span> handles the majority of volume, where exporters purchase graded lots through auction with traceability at the regional level. The <span className='font-semibold'>Direct Specialty License (DSL) channel</span> allows exporters to source directly from cooperatives and washing stations, preserving full traceability to the production site. Both channels converge at the same regulated export pipeline from CLU inspection onward.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        At Ethio Coffee Import and Export PLC, we operate through both channels, drawing on three decades of heritage sourcing relationships with cooperatives and washing stations across <Link href='/insights/guide-ethiopian-coffee-origins' className='underline'>every major Ethiopian coffee region</Link>.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>Incoterms in Coffee Trade</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        International Commercial Terms (Incoterms) define who pays for what and who bears risk at each stage of a coffee shipment. Three terms dominate green coffee commerce:

      <p className='my-4'>
        Coffee importing begins when the vessel carrying your container arrives at the destination port. The importer (or the importer&apos;s customs broker) manages clearance, warehousing, and final delivery to the roaster. Large importers also provide financing, quality assurance, and spot inventory that allows roasters to purchase smaller quantities without committing to full containers.

        <HiOutlineBuildingOffice2 className='inline mr-2 text-amber-600' /> 6. The Green Coffee Buying Process
      </h2>

      <p className='my-4'>
        Green coffee buying follows a structured sequence. Understanding each stage helps importers and roasters plan timelines, manage cash flow, and reduce the risk of quality mismatches.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>The Buying Timeline</h3>
      <ol className='list-decimal ml-6 space-y-3 text-sm my-4'>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Receive offers:</span> The exporter sends an offer sheet listing available lots with origin, grade, processing method, cupping notes, price (FOB or CIF), and available volume. Review our <Link href='/offerings' className='text-amber-700 hover:underline'>current offerings</Link> for an example.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Request and cup samples:</span> The buyer requests 100 to 300g samples, cups them against their roast profile, and evaluates quality. See the <Link href='/insights/how-to-cup-evaluate-ethiopian-coffee-samples' className='text-amber-700 hover:underline'>cupping guide</Link>.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Negotiate and contract:</span> Buyer and exporter agree on price, volume, quality specification, Incoterm, payment method (Letter of Credit, Cash Against Documents, or wire transfer), and delivery timeline. See the <Link href='/insights/ethiopian-coffee-contracts-payment-terms-guide' className='text-amber-700 hover:underline'>contracts guide</Link>.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Milling and preparation:</span> The exporter mills, sorts, and bags the coffee to the contracted specification.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Pre-ship sample approval:</span> Before shipment, the exporter sends a pre-ship sample for buyer approval. This is the buyer&apos;s final quality checkpoint before the coffee leaves origin.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Shipment and documentation:</span> The exporter handles CLU inspection, customs, loading, and shipping. Documents are sent to the buyer&apos;s bank for payment release.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Arrival and payment:</span> The coffee arrives at the destination port. The buyer (or their importer) clears customs, draws an arrival sample, and releases final payment upon approval.</li>
      </ol>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Total lead time from first inquiry to delivery typically runs 3 to 6 months. Forward contracts placed during or before harvest can secure specific lots and lock in pricing. For minimum order requirements, see the <Link href='/insights/minimum-order-quantities-ethiopian-coffee-moq' className='underline font-bold'>MOQ guide</Link>. For information on ordering from Ethio Coffee, see <Link href='/ordering-info' className='underline font-bold'>How to Order</Link>.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>Spot Buying vs. Forward Contracts</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Spot buying means purchasing coffee that is already milled and available for immediate shipment. It offers flexibility and quick turnaround but limits lot selection to whatever is in stock. Forward contracting means committing to a specific lot or specification before harvest or milling is complete. It offers first access to the best lots and price certainty, but requires longer lead times and greater commitment.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Roasters with predictable volume needs benefit from a blended approach: forward contracts for core offerings, spot purchases for seasonal or experimental lots. The <Link href='/insights/ethiopian-coffee-harvest-calendar-buying-guide' className='underline font-bold'>harvest calendar</Link> helps time purchasing decisions around Ethiopian crop cycles.

        <HiOutlineScale className='inline mr-2 text-amber-600' /> 7. Risk Management and Hedging
      </h2>

      <p className='my-4'>
        Coffee commerce involves price risk on both sides of the transaction. When the C market swings $0.50/lb in a quarter (as it did multiple times in 2024 and 2025), unhedged positions can erase an entire season&apos;s margin. Producers face income volatility; buyers face cost volatility. Basic risk management tools help both sides operate more sustainably.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>Tools for Managing Price Risk</h3>
      <ul className='list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 text-sm my-4'>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Futures hedging:</span> Large importers and exporters use ICE coffee futures to lock in prices. An exporter who has purchased physical coffee but not yet sold it can sell futures contracts to offset the risk of a price decline before the sale is completed.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Options contracts:</span> Options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell at a specified price. They provide downside protection while preserving upside potential, at the cost of a premium.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Fixed-price forward contracts:</span> The simplest approach. Buyer and seller agree on a price today for delivery months in the future. Both parties eliminate market risk, but neither benefits from favorable price movements after signing.</li>
        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Price-to-be-fixed (PTBF) contracts:</span> The contract is signed with the differential locked in, but the buyer chooses when to &quot;fix&quot; the C market component within an agreed window. This gives buyers flexibility to time their price fixing based on market conditions.</li>
      </ul>

      {/* SECTION 8: TRANSPARENCY & COMPLIANCE */}
      <h2 id='transparency' className='text-3xl font-extrabold mt-10 mb-4'>
        <HiOutlineShieldCheck className='inline mr-2 text-amber-600' /> 8. Transparency and Compliance
      </h2>

      <p className='my-4'>
        Transparency in coffee commerce means sharing pricing breakdowns, origin data, and supply chain information so every participant can verify that value is distributed fairly. It is also increasingly a regulatory requirement. Buyers who build transparency into their sourcing from the start avoid compliance scrambles later.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>Pricing Transparency</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Request a pricing breakdown from your exporter that shows: farmgate price paid to the producer or cooperative, processing costs, exporter margin, and FOB price. This information enables you to communicate sourcing ethics credibly to your customers and ensures that quality premiums reach the people who produced the coffee. The <Link href='/insights/ethiopian-coffee-traceability-guide' className='underline font-bold'>traceability guide</Link> covers how lot-level data flows through the Ethiopian supply chain.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>EUDR and Regulatory Compliance</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which entered application in 2025, requires importers placing coffee on the EU market to demonstrate that the coffee was not produced on land deforested after December 31, 2020. Compliance requires geolocation data (polygon coordinates for farm plots), due diligence statements, and supply chain documentation linking each lot to its production site.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        For Ethiopian coffee, compliance depends on the export channel. DSL (Direct Specialty License) lots typically have full traceability to the washing station and surrounding farm areas. ECX-channel lots, which are aggregated at the regional level, require additional documentation effort. The <Link href='/insights/eu-deforestation-regulation-ethiopian-coffee-compliance' className='underline font-bold'>EUDR compliance guide</Link> covers the full framework for Ethiopian coffee exports.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>Certifications</h3>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Organic, Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance, and other certifications serve as third-party verification of specific production and trade practices. Ethiopian coffee benefits from a strong certification infrastructure, with many cooperatives holding organic and Fairtrade designations. See the <Link href='/insights/ethiopian-coffee-certifications-organic-fairtrade-rainforest' className='underline font-bold'>certifications guide</Link> for a comparison of what each certification covers and what it costs.

      {/* CONCLUSION */}
      <h2 className='text-3xl font-extrabold mt-10 mb-4'>Conclusion: How Understanding Coffee Commerce Improves Your Sourcing</h2>

      <p className='my-4'>
        Coffee commerce is the system of pricing, logistics, and accountability that connects a roaster&apos;s menu to the cooperatives and washing stations that produced the beans. From C market futures to specialty differentials, from FOB Djibouti to EXW at a destination warehouse, each stage adds cost, adds value, and creates an opportunity for better decisions.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Importers and roasters who understand coffee commerce negotiate better prices, manage risk during volatile markets, plan timelines accurately, and build supply chains that deliver consistent quality year after year. Transparency at every stage, from farmgate pricing to EUDR compliance, is the foundation that makes it all work.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4'>
        At Ethio Coffee Import and Export PLC, we apply this understanding through our trusted sourcing network across Ethiopia&apos;s coffee regions, transparent FOB pricing, and three decades of heritage sourcing relationships with cooperatives and washing stations. Whether you are buying your first container of Ethiopian coffee or your fiftieth, we provide the origin expertise and commercial infrastructure to support your business.

      {/* FAQ */}
      <h2 id='faq' className='text-3xl font-extrabold mt-10 mb-4'>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h4 className='text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2'>What is the C market in coffee?</h4>
      <p className='my-4'>
        The C market is the ICE Arabica coffee futures exchange in New York (ticker: KC). It sets benchmark prices for roughly 90 to 95% of globally traded Arabica. Prices reflect supply, demand, weather, and speculative activity. Most physical coffee is sold at the C price plus or minus a differential that reflects the specific lot&apos;s quality and origin.
      </p>

      <h4 className='text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2'>How does specialty coffee pricing differ from commodity pricing?</h4>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Specialty coffee (SCA 80+) trades at a positive differential above the C market, reflecting cup quality, traceability, and relationship commitments. While commodity prices fluctuate daily, specialty differentials are more stable because they are negotiated directly between buyers and exporters. Higher-scoring lots (86+) show the greatest price stability even during market downturns.
      </p>

      <h4 className='text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2'>What does FOB mean in coffee trade?</h4>
      <p className='my-4'>
        FOB (Free on Board) is the price point where the exporter delivers green coffee loaded onto a vessel at the origin port. It covers sourcing, milling, quality inspection, inland transport, and port loading. Everything after that point (ocean freight, insurance, destination duties) is the buyer&apos;s cost. Most Ethiopian coffee exports are priced FOB Djibouti.
      </p>

      <h4 className='text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2'>What are Incoterms and why do they matter?</h4>
      <p className='my-4'>
        Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) define which party pays for transport, insurance, and customs at each stage of an international shipment. In coffee commerce, the three most common are FOB, CIF, and EXW. Choosing the right Incoterm affects your landed cost, risk exposure, and logistics responsibilities. The Incoterm must be specified in the purchase contract.
      </p>

      <h4 className='text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2'>How long does the green coffee buying timeline take?</h4>
      <p className='my-4'>
        A typical cycle from first inquiry to delivery runs 3 to 6 months. Key stages include sample evaluation, contract negotiation, milling and CLU inspection, pre-ship sample approval, ocean freight (18 to 35 days depending on destination), and customs clearance. Forward contracts placed before harvest can extend the total timeline but secure the best lots and pricing.
