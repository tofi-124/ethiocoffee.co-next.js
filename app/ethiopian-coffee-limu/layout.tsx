        text: 'Limu coffee is grown in southwestern Ethiopia at 1,400-2,000 meters altitude. It is prized for its wine-toned acidity, spicy character, and well-balanced body. Limu is predominantly washed processed and offers one of the best value propositions in Ethiopian specialty coffee - delivering clean, complex cups at accessible price points.'

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'While Yirgacheffe is known for delicate floral and citrus aromatics with a tea-like body, Limu tends toward wine-like, spicy flavors with a fuller body. Limu grows at slightly lower altitudes (1,400-2,000m vs 1,700-2,200m) and is located in southwestern Ethiopia. Limu is generally more affordable than Yirgacheffe while still delivering specialty-grade quality.'

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Limu coffee is primarily exported as Grade 2 (SCA 83-85+, specialty) and Grade 3 (SCA 82-83, commercial specialty). Grade 2 Limu is the preferred choice for single-origin specialty use. Nearly all exported Limu is washed processed.'

      name: 'How much does Limu coffee cost FOB?',
      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Grade 2 washed Limu: $2.80-$3.80/lb FOB Djibouti. Grade 3: $2.40-$3.00/lb. Limu typically commands lower premiums than Yirgacheffe or Guji, making it an excellent value for specialty blends and year-round programs. Contact us for current pricing.'
