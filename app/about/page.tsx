    year: 'It started on the road',
    description: 'When our father was young, he traveled across Ethiopia with our grandfather, who traded goods from region to region. Those trips taught him how communities work, how trust is earned, and how much care goes into what the land produces.'
  },
  {
    year: 'Coffee became personal',
    description: "Our grandfather traded many goods, but coffee is what captured our father's attention and never let go. As he got deeper into the coffee world, he saw something that never sat right: the farmers doing the hardest work were often the last to benefit when the coffee left the village."
  },
  {
    year: 'Trust built one season at a time',
    description: 'So he did what he always did: he showed up. He spent years working closely with farming communities, learning how coffee is grown and prepared, supporting cooperatives so farmers could access better markets and keep more value. Those relationships became the sourcing network we rely on today.'
  },
  {
    year: 'Thirty years of local trade and relationships',
    description: 'For three decades, our father worked with farmers, cooperatives, and local buyers across Ethiopia, moving coffee season after season. He learned what buyers need, what farmers face, and how small details in picking, drying, sorting, and storage decide whether a lot stays great or loses value. That long, practical experience is the foundation we stand on today.'
  },
  {
    year: 'In 2022, we took it international',
    description: "Our father built his reputation in local trade through relationships he earned over decades. In 2022, we, two brothers, formalized Ethio Coffee Import and Export PLC to take that sourcing network to the international market. We brought on an export manager with over 15 years of experience in international coffee trade to lead our export operations, building a team with clearer communication, better transparency, and quality our partners can plan around."
  },
  {
    year: 'Our own drying station in Guji Hambella',
    description: 'We established our own drying station in Guji Hambella, one of Ethiopia\'s most celebrated specialty coffee origins. We now collect cherry directly from smallholder farmers in the area and process it ourselves, giving us hands-on control over quality from cherry intake through drying. This deepens our presence at origin and strengthens the traceability we offer our buyers.'
  },
  {
    year: 'Today, we export with purpose',
    description: 'At our own drying station in Guji Hambella, we collect cherry from smallholder farmers and process it ourselves. Across other origins, we work with cooperatives and washing stations we trust. Everything comes together at our warehouse in Addis Ababa, where we prepare lots for export to buyers who care about traceability and consistency. We still measure success the same way we were taught: by keeping promises, protecting quality, and making sure farmers remain central to the story.'

                Established in 2022, we draw on three decades of family heritage in Ethiopia's coffee trade - a sourcing network our father built over 30 years as a local coffee trader. Today that means running our own drying station in Guji Hambella, where we work directly with smallholder farmers in the area, collecting their cherry and processing it ourselves to support their livelihoods and protect quality. For other key origins like Yirgacheffe, Sidama, Harar, and Limu, we source through trusted cooperatives and washing stations. Our mission is simple: to ensure the value stays where it belongs with the growers, while being the reliable, transparent partner importers can count on.

              Great coffee doesn't happen by accident. It's grown, picked, processed, sorted, and moved by hand, often by families who have been doing this work for generations.
              Our job is to honor that effort with consistency, clear communication, and long-term relationships.
