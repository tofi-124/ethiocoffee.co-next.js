        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Washed Yirgacheffe has a cleaner, brighter cup with pronounced floral aromatics (jasmine, bergamot), citrus acidity (lemon, bergamot), and a tea-like body. Natural Yirgacheffe tends to be fruitier and sweeter with berry, tropical fruit, and wine-like characteristics with a heavier body. Washed is more common and considered the classic Yirgacheffe profile.'
