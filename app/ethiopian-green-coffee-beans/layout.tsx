They are sold in their natural green state to roasters and importers worldwide, who then roast them to create finished coffee products. Ethiopian greens are prized for their complex floral, fruity, and wine-like flavour profiles."

Washed Yirgacheffe also works brilliantly as a bright, floral single-origin espresso. Many roasters blend Ethiopian greens with Brazilian or Colombian coffees for balanced espresso profiles."
