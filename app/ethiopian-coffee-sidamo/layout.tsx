      name: 'What does Sidamo coffee taste like?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Sidamo (Sidama) coffee is known for its complex berry and stone fruit notes, floral aromatics, wine-like acidity, and rich mouthfeel. Washed Sidamo tends toward citrus and floral brightness, while natural Sidamo delivers intense blueberry, strawberry, and dark chocolate sweetness. SCA scores typically range from 84-87+.' }

      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'What is the difference between Sidamo and Yirgacheffe coffee?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Yirgacheffe is technically a sub-region within the broader Sidama zone, but its coffees are so distinctive that they are classified separately. Yirgacheffe is known for lighter, more floral and citrus-driven profiles, while broader Sidamo coffees tend to be heavier-bodied with more pronounced berry and wine notes. Both are exceptional specialty origins.' }

    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'What grades of Sidamo coffee are exported?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Sidamo coffee is exported as Grade 1 (SCA 86+, minimal defects) and Grade 2 (SCA 84-86). Both grades are available in washed and natural processing. Grade 1 naturals from Bensa and Nensebo are particularly sought after for their intense blueberry and strawberry notes.' }
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'How much does Sidamo coffee cost FOB?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Grade 2 washed Sidamo typically ranges from $3.20-$4.50/lb FOB Djibouti. Grade 1 naturals command $4.00-$6.00/lb FOB depending on cup score and processing station. Sidamo often offers better value than Yirgacheffe at comparable quality levels. Contact us for current pricing.' }

    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'Where is Sidamo coffee grown?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Sidamo (now officially Sidama) coffee is grown in the Sidama Regional State of southern Ethiopia, at altitudes of 1,550-2,200 meters. Major growing districts include Bensa, Dale, Aleta Wendo, Chire, and Nensebo. The region benefits from volcanic soil, ample rainfall, and ideal temperatures for specialty Arabica production.' }
