        text: 'Harar (also spelled Harrar) is one of the oldest and most historic coffee origins in the world. Grown in eastern Ethiopia near the ancient walled city of Harar at 1,500-2,100 meters altitude, Harar coffee is exclusively natural (dry) processed, producing its signature wild berry, wine-like, dark chocolate, and spicy "mocha" character. Harar longberry is among Ethiopia\'s most iconic coffee exports.'

      name: 'What is Harar longberry vs shortberry?',
      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Harar coffee is classified by bean size: Longberry (large, elongated beans) is the premium grade with the most intense flavor. Shortberry (smaller, rounder beans) is more widely available and offers a slightly lighter profile. Both are natural-processed and exhibit Harar\'s characteristic wild berry and wine flavors.'

      name: 'What grades of Harar coffee are available for export?',
      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Harar is traditionally graded as Grade 4 (higher quality, longberry) and Grade 5 (commercial, shortberry). Unlike washed coffees, Harar uses a different grading scale that accounts for natural processing characteristics. Top Harar lots score 82-86+ on the SCA scale.'

        text: 'FOB Djibouti pricing for Harar varies by classification. Grade 4 Longberry: $3.00-$4.50/lb. Grade 5 Shortberry: $2.50-$3.50/lb. Premium sorted longberry can command higher prices. Contact us for current pricing and availability.'

      name: 'Why is Harar coffee called mocha?',
      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'The term "mocha" in coffee originally referred to the port of Mocha (Al Mokha) in Yemen, through which Ethiopian Harar coffee was historically traded. Harar\'s natural chocolate and wine-like qualities led to "mocha" becoming synonymous with chocolate-coffee flavors. Ethiopian Harar is considered the original "mocha" coffee.'
