Additional factors include bean size, moisture content, and processing method. The grading is administered through the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) and the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Authority (ECTA)."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Grade 1 Ethiopian coffee is the highest quality designation, requiring 0-3 defects per 300g sample and a minimum SCA cup score of 85+. It represents the best lots from any given origin - clean, well-sorted, free of foreign matter, with outstanding cup character. Grade 1 commands the highest export prices and is sought by specialty roasters worldwide."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Grade 1 allows 0-3 defects per 300g and scores SCA 85+, while Grade 2 allows 4-12 defects and scores SCA 80+. In the cup, both are specialty quality, but Grade 1 lots are exceptionally clean with more outstanding clarity and complexity. Pricing for Grade 1 is typically 10-20% higher than Grade 2. Both grades are suitable for specialty single-origin offerings."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Grade 1 and Grade 2 Ethiopian coffees are considered specialty grade, scoring SCA 80+ on cupping protocol. These grades meet the Specialty Coffee Association's definition of specialty coffee. Grade 3 coffees (scoring 75-79) are considered 'premium commercial' and can be high quality but don't meet the SCA specialty threshold."

          "text": "Yes, significantly. Grade 1 Ethiopian coffee commands the highest prices ($10-$13+/kg FOB), followed by Grade 2 ($9-$11/kg). Commercial grades (3-5) trade at lower levels. Within each grade, price is further influenced by origin (Yirgacheffe and Guji command premiums), processing method (naturals often price higher than washed), and seasonal supply conditions."
