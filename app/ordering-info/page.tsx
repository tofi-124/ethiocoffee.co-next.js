        question: 'How is green coffee traded internationally?',
        answer: (
          <>
            <p>
              Unlike most coffee origins, Ethiopian coffee is <strong>not priced against the New York C Market</strong>. Pricing is set domestically through the <strong>Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX)</strong>, which establishes floor prices, manages quality grading, and handles price discovery based on grade, region, and quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ECX floor price applies to all Ethiopian coffee regardless of sales channel. However, not all coffee trades through the ECX auction itself. Cooperatives, unions, and vertically integrated exporters who own their own washing stations can sell directly to international buyers. This direct channel is especially common for traceable specialty lots, but the ECX floor price still sets the minimum.
            </p>
            <p>
              Export prices are quoted in <strong>USD per pound</strong>. We typically offer <strong>fixed-price contracts</strong>, giving buyers clear cost certainty. Prices vary by origin, grade (G1 through G5), and processing method (washed vs. natural). We provide transparent, itemized quotations so you know exactly what you are paying for.
            </p>

        question: 'What is a full container load (FCL) and why is it the standard?',
        answer: (
          <>
            <p>
              A <strong>Full Container Load (FCL)</strong> uses a standard 20-foot shipping container exclusively for your cargo. For green coffee, one FCL holds approximately:
            </p>
            <ul className='list-disc pl-5 space-y-1'>
              <li><strong>~20 metric tons</strong> (20,000 kg)</li>
              <li><strong>~44,000 lbs</strong></li>
              <li><strong>~275–320 bags</strong> at 60 kg per bag</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              FCL is the standard because it is the most cost-efficient unit for ocean freight. The per-kg shipping cost drops significantly compared to smaller shipments. It also eliminates co-loading risk (your coffee sharing a container with other goods).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>LCL (Less than Container Load)</strong> is possible but rarely recommended: it costs more per kg, adds handling risk, and extends transit time. For new buyers, we encourage starting with a full container, using the mix-and-match option to diversify across multiple origins or grades.
            </p>

        question: 'What does FOB mean and how does pricing work?',
        answer: (
          <>
            <p>
              <strong>FOB (Free on Board)</strong> is the most common Incoterm in green coffee trade. It means the seller (us) covers all costs until the coffee is loaded onto the vessel at the export port. From that point, the buyer assumes responsibility and cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Ethiopian coffee, the standard export point is <strong>FOB Djibouti</strong>, the nearest major port, approximately 900 km from Addis Ababa.
            </p>
            <ul className='list-disc pl-5 space-y-1'>
              <li><strong>FOB price covers:</strong> coffee cost, inland trucking to Djibouti, port handling, and export documentation</li>
              <li><strong>Buyer arranges and pays for:</strong> ocean freight, marine insurance, import duties and customs clearance, and delivery to final destination</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We also offer <strong>FCA (Free Carrier)</strong> terms for air freight, where we deliver to the carrier at Addis Ababa airport or a nominated freight station.

        question: 'What are the key documents in a green coffee shipment?',
        answer: (
          <>
            <p>Every international green coffee shipment requires a standard set of documents. Here is what each one does:</p>
            <ul className='list-disc pl-5 space-y-2'>
              <li><strong>Commercial Invoice:</strong> States the buyer, seller, quantity, description, and agreed price. Required for customs in your country.</li>
              <li><strong>Packing List:</strong> Details each bag's weight, lot number, and markings. Used for customs and warehouse receiving.</li>
              <li><strong>Bill of Lading (B/L):</strong> The shipping contract and title document. Issued by the shipping line. You need this to release your container at destination.</li>
              <li><strong>Certificate of Origin / ICO Certificate:</strong> Confirms the coffee originated in Ethiopia. Required by most importing countries for customs clearance and duty calculation.</li>
              <li><strong>Phytosanitary Certificate:</strong> Issued by Ethiopia's Ministry of Agriculture. Confirms the coffee is free from pests and plant diseases. Required for import into virtually every country.</li>
              <li><strong>ECX Quality & Weight Certificate:</strong> Confirms the grade and weight certified by the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange.</li>
              <li><strong>Organic / Fair Trade / Rainforest Alliance Certificates:</strong> Included when applicable for certified lots.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Import requirements vary by destination. Here are the key ones to know:</p>
            <ul className='list-disc pl-5 space-y-2'>
              <li>
                <strong>United States:</strong> FDA Prior Notice required before shipment arrives. No specific coffee import duty (MFN rate is 0%) for green, unroasted coffee. Your customs broker handles entry and FDA clearance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>European Union:</strong> Subject to the <strong>EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)</strong>, which requires due diligence documentation proving the coffee was not grown on deforested land. We provide the traceability data needed. Standard import duty on green coffee (unroasted) is 0% under MFN tariff.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>United Kingdom:</strong> Similar to EU. Phytosanitary certificate required. Green coffee is duty-free under the UK Global Tariff.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Canada:</strong> No coffee-specific import duty. Health Canada food safety regulations apply. Phytosanitary certificate required.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Australia:</strong> DAFF (Dept. of Agriculture) biosecurity import permit may be required. Phytosanitary certificate mandatory.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We recommend working with a licensed customs broker in your country. They handle the paperwork, calculate duties, and ensure your shipment clears without delays. We provide all export-side documentation to support your broker.

            <p>Here is a realistic timeline for a standard FCL order:</p>
            <ul className='list-disc pl-5 space-y-2'>
              <li><strong>Week 1–2:</strong> Sample approval, quotation, contract signing, and deposit payment</li>
              <li><strong>Week 2–4:</strong> Coffee is prepared, quality-checked, bagged, and loaded in Addis Ababa</li>
              <li><strong>Week 4–5:</strong> Inland transport to Djibouti port, customs clearance, and vessel loading</li>
              <li><strong>Transit (ocean):</strong> 2–3 weeks to Middle East, 4–5 weeks to Europe, 6–8 weeks to North America or East Asia</li>
              <li><strong>Destination:</strong> Port arrival, customs clearance (3–10 days depending on country), and delivery to your warehouse</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Total time from contract to warehouse: typically <strong>8–14 weeks</strong> depending on destination. Planning your inventory around this lead time is key.

        question: 'What is a pre-shipment sample (PSS) and do I need one?',
        answer: (
          <>
            <p>
              A <strong>Pre-Shipment Sample (PSS)</strong> is a small quantity (typically 300–500g) pulled from the actual lot that will be loaded into your container. It is sent to you for cupping and approval before shipment begins.
            </p>
            <p>
              PSS approval is standard practice in specialty coffee trade and strongly recommended. It serves as your final quality check and creates a reference point: if the received coffee differs significantly from the PSS, you have documented grounds for a quality claim.
            </p>
            <p>
              We provide PSS as part of every wholesale export order, accompanied by cupping notes, physical analysis, and lot documentation.

      Our <strong>minimum order quantity is one full container load (FCL)</strong>, approximately <strong>20 metric tons / 44,000 lbs</strong>, or roughly 275–320 bags (60 kg each). This is the standard unit of international green coffee trade and the most cost-effective option for ocean freight.

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Less than full load:</strong> While we can ship less than a full container load in a full container, our strong recommendation is to maximize value by ordering a full container. Partial loads may incur additional per-unit costs.

The <strong className='text-dark'>Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX)</strong> sets floor prices based on grade, region, and quality, and these floors apply to all Ethiopian coffee regardless of sales channel. Not all coffee moves through the ECX auction itself: cooperatives and licensed exporters can sell directly to international buyers, particularly for traceable specialty lots, with the ECX floor price still setting the minimum.
