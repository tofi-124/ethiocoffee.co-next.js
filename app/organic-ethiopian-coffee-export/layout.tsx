      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Much of Ethiopian coffee is grown organically by default, as most smallholder farmers use traditional farming methods without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. However, "certified organic" requires formal certification (USDA, EU, or JAS) through an accredited agency, which involves audits, documentation, and compliance costs. We source from cooperatives and farms that hold these certifications.'

      name: 'What organic certifications are available for Ethiopian coffee?',
      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Ethiopian organic coffee is available with USDA Organic (for the US market), EU Organic (for European markets), and JAS Organic (for Japan). Some lots also carry additional certifications like Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, or UTZ. Availability depends on the season and specific cooperatives.'

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Certified organic Ethiopian coffee typically commands a premium of $0.30-$0.80/lb over conventional equivalent grades. The exact premium depends on the origin, grade, current market conditions, and whether additional certifications (Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance) are included. Contact us for current pricing.'

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Standard minimum order is one full container load (FCL) - approximately 19.2 metric tons. Organic lots must be kept separate from conventional during storage, transport, and shipping to maintain certification integrity. You can mix different organic origins within the same container.'

        text: 'Certified organic Ethiopian coffee is primarily available from Yirgacheffe, Sidamo (Sidama), Guji, and Limu regions. Many cooperatives in these areas hold organic certification. Harar and Jimma regions also have some certified organic production, though availability is more limited.'
